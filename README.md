# Arabian vACC - QGIS Ground Layouts
Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the Arabian Virtual Area Control Center (vACC), specifically focused on controller client ground layouts designed for use with the Ground Radar Plugin (GRplugin). This repository contains open-source resources intended for use within the VATSIM network, offering an invaluable tool for air traffic controllers in the Arabian vACC to visualize and manage ground operations more effectively.

The ground layouts are an essential part of ensuring that controllers have a clear and accurate representation of ground operations, including taxiways, runways, gates, and other critical airport infrastructure. These layouts are integrated with the Ground Radar Plugin (GRplugin), providing controllers with enhanced situational awareness on the ground, which is crucial for maintaining smooth and safe operations within the virtual airspace.

As an open-source project, we highly encourage collaboration from the community. Whether youâ€™re an experienced air traffic controller, a developer, or someone with a strong interest in improving the quality of ground radar layouts, your contributions are welcome. Updating and improving these layouts is vital to keeping the information that controllers see on their screens current and accurate, ensuring that all involved parties have the best possible tools to manage operations on the VATSIM network.

Please note that extensive knowledge of QGIS is required to effectively contribute to this repository. QGIS is a powerful, open-source mapping tool that is essential for creating, editing, and maintaining the ground layouts used in this project. If you are not familiar with QGIS, we recommend familiarizing yourself with it before attempting to contribute.

While this repository is supported by the Arabian vACC, please be aware that **no technical support will be provided by the Arabian vACC** operations team for issues related to the QGIS software or the plugin itself. This is a community-driven project, and users are expected to troubleshoot and resolve any issues independently or through collaboration with fellow contributors.

We look forward to your contributions and hope that this repository will help improve the quality and accuracy of air traffic control on the VATSIM network, especially for the Arabian vACC. Let's work together to enhance virtual aviation experiences for all!
